✦ Analysis of the stack Module

  This module provides a straightforward and thread-safe implementation of a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)
  stack. It is built upon a contiguous array, making it memory-efficient and cache-friendly for its
  operations.

  Qualitative Feedback


   * Strengths:
       * Thread-Safety: The use of a mutex to protect all public operations (push, pop, peek) is a
         significant advantage, making the stack immediately usable in concurrent applications without
         requiring external locking.
       * Performance: The underlying array implementation ensures that push, pop, and peek are all
         O(1) operations, which is the optimal time complexity for a stack.
       * Simplicity and Clarity: The API is minimal and follows standard conventions, making it easy
         to understand and use correctly.
       * Robustness: The implementation includes checks for stack overflow (pushing to a full stack)
         and underflow (popping from an empty stack), preventing common runtime errors.


   * Areas for Improvement:
       * Fixed Capacity: The most significant limitation is that the stack has a fixed capacity
         determined at construction. If a user attempts to push more elements than the initial size
         allows, the operation will fail with a stack overflow error. A more flexible implementation
         would automatically resize the underlying array when it becomes full.
       * Memory Ownership: The stack stores void * pointers but does not manage the memory of the items
          themselves. When stack_destroy is called, it frees the stack's internal array but not the
         data pointed to by the elements. This is a common design choice in C but requires careful
         memory management from the user to avoid leaks. This should be clearly documented.
       * Redundant `create` and `construct`: The stack_create function is only ever called by
         stack_construct. These could be merged into a single, more streamlined internal function.

  Ideas for Extending the Interface

  Here are some suggestions for enhancing the stack module's functionality:

  1. Core Functionality and Usability




   * Dynamic Resizing: Modify stack_push to automatically realloc the internal _p_data array (e.g.,
     doubling its size) when the stack is full. This would remove the fixed-capacity limitation and
     make the data structure more versatile.
   * `stack_size`: An O(1) function to get the current number of items in the stack. This is a
     fundamental feature that is currently missing.

   1     size_t stack_size(const stack *const p_stack);

   * `stack_is_empty`: A boolean convenience function that is more idiomatic than checking if the
     size is zero.

   1     bool stack_is_empty(const stack *const p_stack);

   * `stack_clear`: A function to remove all elements from the stack without destroying the stack
     itself.

   1     int stack_clear(stack *const p_stack);

   * `stack_clear_with_deleter`: An extension of clear that accepts a function pointer to also free
     the memory of each element, helping users manage memory correctly.


   1     int stack_clear_with_deleter(stack *const p_stack, void (*pfn_deleter)(void *));


  2. Advanced Iteration


   * Iterator Struct: For more flexible and safe iteration without exposing the internal array, an
     iterator is a powerful pattern.


    1     typedef struct stack_iterator_s stack_iterator;
    2 
    3     // Creates an iterator starting at the top of the stack
    4     stack_iterator *stack_iterator_create(stack *const p_stack);
    5 
    6     // Moves to the next element down, returns false if at the bottom
    7     bool stack_iterator_next(stack_iterator *it);
    8 
    9     // Gets the value at the current iterator position
   10     void *stack_iterator_get_value(stack_iterator *it);
   11 
   12     // Frees the iterator
   13     void stack_iterator_destroy(stack_iterator *it);


  3. Concurrency Enhancements

  Since the stack is already thread-safe, it's a great candidate for blocking operations, which
  are common in producer-consumer patterns.


   * Blocking Pop: A version of pop that blocks if the stack is empty, waiting until an item is
     pushed by another thread. This would likely require adding a condition_variable to the struct 
     stack_s.

   1     int stack_pop_blocking(stack *const p_stack, const void **const ret);

   * Timed Pop: A blocking pop that waits for a specified duration before timing out if no item
     becomes available.

   1     int stack_pop_timed(stack *const p_stack, const void **const ret, int timeout_ms);
