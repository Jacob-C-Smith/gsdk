✦ That's a great question. The gsdk already has a strong foundation of core data structures. Based on what's present, here are a few suggestions for new data structures that
  would complement the existing modules, categorized by their potential use case:

  1. String and Prefix-Based Lookups


   * Trie (Prefix Tree): This would be a powerful addition for any application that needs efficient dictionary-like lookups based on string prefixes.
       * Why it fits: It's highly efficient for auto-completion, spell-checking, and IP routing tables. Given the presence of networking and serialization modules, a Trie would
         be a natural fit for handling and searching string-based keys or identifiers.

  2. High-Performance Range Queries


   * Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or Segment Tree: These are specialized structures built on top of an array to perform range queries (e.g., sum, min, max over a range of
     elements) and element updates in logarithmic time.
       * Why it fits: The gsdk has a clear focus on performance. A Fenwick or Segment tree would be a valuable tool for applications in data analysis, competitive programming,
         or any domain requiring fast aggregation over dynamic datasets.


  3. Memory-Efficient Probabilistic Structures

  For handling very large datasets where absolute precision can be traded for significant memory and performance gains.


   * Bloom Filter: A probabilistic structure to test whether an element is a member of a set. It can have false positives but no false negatives.
       * Why it fits: Excellent for high-performance applications like checking if a username is already taken, filtering seen items in a web crawler, or avoiding expensive
         disk lookups for non-existent keys in a database cache.
   * HyperLogLog: An algorithm for estimating the cardinality (number of unique elements) of a very large set.
       * Why it fits: Perfect for large-scale data analytics, like estimating the number of unique visitors to a website or unique items in a massive data stream, without
         storing all the items.

  4. Concurrency


  While the existing structures are made thread-safe with mutexes, you could add data structures specifically designed for high-concurrency scenarios.


   * Lock-Free Queue/Stack: These use atomic operations instead of mutexes, allowing multiple threads to perform push and pop operations without blocking each other.
       * Why it fits: This would be a major feature for the performance/parallel module, enabling extremely fast, non-blocking communication between threads in a
         multi-producer, multi-consumer scenario.

  Of these, a Trie and a Bloom Filter are often the most broadly applicable and would likely provide immediate value to a general-purpose SDK like this one.


  Do any of these sound particularly interesting or useful for your current goals?
